        <h2>Why is the atmosphere important?</h2>
        <p>The atmosphere has several important functions, all of which are needed to sustain life on earth. There are 4
            major gases which make up air in Earth's atmosphere, they are Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.93%)
            and Carbon dioxide (0.04%). Gases like carbon dioxide play a role in the absorption and retention of heat
            from the suns rays, which inevitably keeps Earth at the perfect temperature to support life forms. Oxygen is
            also an essential gas, used by organisms in the process of respiration.

        <img src="<?php bloginfo('wpurl')?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-4.png">
        <p>Another major function is protecting life forms from the harmful ultra- violet radiation from the sun. This
            is achieved by the small concentrations of ozone in the upper reaches of the stratosphere. Lastly, the
            atmosphere is where the development of clouds occurs. Clouds are collections of millions and trillions of
            tiny water droplets and are the structures responsible for all essential precipitation. </p>

                    (NO<sub>x</sub>). Other nitrogen oxides include nitrous acid and nitric acid. NO<sub>2</sub> is
                    emitted
                    through the burning of various types of fuels. Sources include cars, trucks, buses, power plants,

                    however describes particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, these are extremely fine
                    and
                    can
                    also be inhaled. These pollutants can be detrimental to an individuals health as they make their way

                    of
                    fields, smokestacks, wild fires or they also originate from complex reactions of chemicals in the

            <p>There are many different types of air quality control instruments that are used to measure the
                concentrations of any given pollutant in the atmosphere. In South Africa there are currently 94 air
                quality monitoring stations that have been set up by the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Network
                (NAAQMN). These stations are monitored and operated by the South African government. There are many
                non-governmental organisations that have their own stations as well. The data from these stations is
                used to ensure that the concentrations of certain pollutants do not exceed legal and health limits.
                These instruments are mainly used to measure pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, lead,
                ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.</p>

        <p>Greenhouse gases are chemicals such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. These chemicals are
            present in the atmosphere and are capable of absorbing large amounts of heat from the sun. These gases play
            an essential role in maintaining earths surface temperatures in order to support life. However as human
            activities increase the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere, more heat is absorbed causing
            global average temperatures to increase.</p>

                    <p>Greenhouses are large glass structures that are ideal for growing plants all year round.
                        Greenhouses make plant growth in the winter possible because heat from the sun is trapped inside
                        the glass, so even on cold winter nights the temperatures within the greenhouse remain moderate
                        and comfortable enough to keep plants alive. Similarly, greenhouse gases act as the glass of the
                        greenhouse, they surround the earth in the atmosphere and are responsible for the absorption of
                        heat from the sun. The greenhouse effect is very important as it ensures that temperatures at
                        the earths surface are well within range to sustain all life forms. However, when there is an
                        excess amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere, there is more gas to absorb heat
                        and this creates an enhanced greenhouse effect. It is this enhanced greenhouse effect that is
                        responsible an increase in global temperatures, bringing about global warming and climate

                <h4>Increasing Average Global Temperatures</h4>
                <p>The increase in greenhouse gas emissions means that there is a larger concentration of gas present in
                    the atmosphere that are able to absorb and re-radiate heat from the suns rays. This increases the
                    amount of heat that is trapped within the earths atmosphere and results in global average
                    temperatures rising significantly, we call this phenomenon, global warming. Increased temperatures
                    cause changes in the otherwise predictable weather conditions as well as fluctuations in rainfall
                    patterns. There are six major effects global warming and climate change, they are droughts, floods,

                <p>Areas surrounding major deserts suffer severely from these increases in temperatures and decreases in
                    rainfall. As they become more and more dry they begin to replicate the climates of the deserts they
                    lie close to (desertification). This means that they can no longer support the plant and animal life

                <h4>Melting Ice Caps</h4>
                <p>When temperatures rise, large islands and glaciers of ice found at the Southern and Northern poles of
                    the globe, begin to melt. The melting of this ice results in the rising of sea levels. Major cities
                    that lie right on coast lines (all over the world) face issues like coastal erosion and flooding.
                    Another issue that results from the melting of polar ice-caps is that there are animals that call
                    these parts of the world home. Polar bears, Emperor penguins and snow leopards all suffer as their
                    habitats are destroyed. Polar bears for example go hunting in search of food and then cannot find
                    pieces of ice large enough to rest on, eventually they are too exhausted to swim and they drown.</p>

                <h4>Droughts and Floods</h4>
                <p>The fluctuations in rainfall patterns results in flooding and droughts. If rain becomes more
                    frequent, it causes flooding and if rainfall decreases it causes droughts. Places like Durban have
                    struggled with flooding while Cape Town was facing severe water restrictions in 2018 as a result of
                    drought. These natural disasters are bad for farmers and the agricultural industry as crops suffer
                    and food becomes more expensive. Droughts and floods also affect plants and animals and can decrease

                <h4>Wildfires</h4>
                <p>The fluctuations in rainfall patterns results in flooding and droughts. If rain becomes more
                    frequent, it causes flooding and if rainfall decreases it causes droughts. Places like Durban have
                    struggled with flooding while Cape Town was facing severe water restrictions in 2018 as a result of
                    drought. These natural disasters are bad for farmers and the agricultural industry as crops suffer
                    and food becomes more expensive. Droughts and floods also affect plants and animals and can decrease
                    biodiversity.</p>

        <h2>What is the South African government doing about air quality?</h2>
        <p>South Africa has had strict rules and regulations regarding air quality since 2004 when the Air Quality Act
            was established. The enforcement of these rules and regulations falls upon the Minister of Environmental
            Affairs. Since 2004 many framework and management strategies have been implemented in governments attempts
            to improve air quality in South Africa. Ozone depleting substances have been phased- out, ambient air
            quality standards for seven pollutants have been established and emission limitations have been imposed on
            small- scale charcoal plants. These are just a few of the strategies that government have carried out. These
            are however ongoing attempts to improve air quality and environmental impacts, for example President Cyril
            Ramaphosa in 2019 signed a Carbon Tax Act into law. This act charges greenhouse gas emitters for every
            certain amount of pollutant they release into the atmosphere in a year. </p>

        <h2>What are NGO's doing about air pollution?</h2>
        <p>There are many majorly influential NGO's that are also involved in trying to improve air quality not only in
            South Africa but around the world. For example The World Health Organisation is heavily involved in the
            implementation of air quality legislation all over the world and has labelled air pollution as the single
            biggest environmental health crisis of our time. As an NGO your priorities include education and advocacy.
            Education because NGO's make it their responsibility to make the public and influential members of society
            aware of the issue they are supporting. Advocacy involves trying to get government to pass laws and respond
            to the issues you think are important, this could include anything from organizing peaceful protests to
            getting people to sign a petition.</p>

            <h3>Using Sustainable Energy Sources</h3>
            <p>Sustainable energy sources produce electricity and power without the use of fossil fuels. There are
                several types that have been implemented all over the world to decrease air pollution from the
                production of electricity. Because criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases are both emitted from the
                same sources, by using sustainable energy options you decrease the negative affects on both the
                environment and on peoples health.</p>

                    <p>Solar panels harvest energy from the sun and convert it into a more useful form such as
                        electricity.
                        Photo-voltaic systems are used to create electricity and concentrated solar power is used mainly
                        for

                        and

                    <p>Wind power is most effective in places that experience high wind speeds and gales on a regular
                        basis.
                        Huge
                        blades are positioned on poles which extend relatively high up into the atmosphere (these are
                        known
                        as
                        wind
                        turbines), the wind then turns these large blades creating mechanical power which powers
                        electrical
                        generators. Places where many of these turbines are found together are known as wind farms. Wind
                        farms
                        do to
                        some extent disadvantage the environment as they require large pieces of land, more land than an

                    <h4>Hydro Power</h4>
                    <p>Hydro means water, therefore hydro power refers to energy or electricity generated by falling or
                        fast-
                        running water. This form of energy generation has also been used to power irrigation systems as
                        well as many other
                        kinds of
                        equipment. These power stations enormously reduce the amount of emissions released into the
                        atmosphere. In order for hydro power stations to be established, dams need to be constructed.
                        Dams are created by building a wall somewhere along a rivers course, this means that water that
                        would
                        normally flow downstream is now trapped behind a dam wall. This can be
                        damaging to the environment because it can
                        often
                        lead to droughts, floods and decreased biodiversity for the areas surrounding the river
                        downstream.

                    emissions and if facilities exceed the given restrictions they are then heavily fined. In many
