                <p>The atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding the earth, the layer closest to the surface of the
                    earth is known as the Troposphere. Humans, plants and animals breathe and exist in this lower layer.

                <h3>Why is the atmosphere so important?</h3>
                <p>The atmosphere supports life on our planet by providing oxygen, an essential gas, to all living
                    creatures, protecting us from harmful UV rays from the sun. Water in the atmosphere helps to from
                    clouds and is responsible for life giving rain that fills our rivers and dams.</p>

                    <p>Air pollution is the release of harmful chemicals and gases into the air we breathe (the
                        atmosphere).
                        There are two main types of air pollution they are known as greenhouse gases and criteria
                        pollutants.

                        <p>Greenhouse gases are very bad for the environment, they cause global warming and climate
                            change. Examples of greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and methane. The reason these gases
                            are so harmful is because they are very good at absorbing energy, in the form of heat, that
                            originates from the sun. This means the more of these gases there are in the atmosphere, the
                            higher the temperatures are going to be at earths surface in the future.</p>

                            dioxide, particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, lead and benzene. When these
                            pollutants are released into the air and we breathe them into our lungs they make people
                            very sick. Two of the criteria pollutants, sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, are also
                            bad for the environment because they pollute our water and damage the homes of many animals
                            and plants.</p>

                <p>Air pollution as already discussed affects the planet in two major ways, the first is destruction of
                    the environment and the second is damage to people's health. As we know there are two major
                    contributors to these effects, both greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants.</p>
                <p>When greenhouse gases are released in large amounts into the air, heat that originates from the sun
                    is absorbed by these gases and increases the temperature of the atmosphere around our planet for us
                    and other living things. This is what scientists call global warming or climate change. This
                    increase in temperature is likely to lead more extreme droughts, floods and wild fires, melting of
                    ice-caps at the poles and even desertification (the process by which land becomes more like a
                    desert).</p>
                <p>Criteria pollutants on the other hand are mainly responsible for making people sick. If you would
                    like to know more about these pollutants and how they effect the different parts of your body as

                            Floods can be very dangerous as they wash houses, cars and buildings away, sometimes if

                            bad for farmers as they destroy crops and therefore reduces the amount of food available for

                            it disappears they struggle to survive. The melting of this ice also means there is more
                            water in the oceans and this causes sea levels to rise. Rising sea levels may result in
                            places close to the coast being flooded. Islands countries such as the Maldives are

                <p>Power stations are the places where we make electricity. Fossil fuel burning power stations release
                    large amounts harmful greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. So when you are done using lights or
                    anything that uses electricity, turn them off. This will reduce the amount of energy power stations
                    need to produce.</p>

                <p>When you recycle you make sure that new products are made out of materials that already exist. This
                    means that new materials do not have to be made again and this saves electricity and energy and
                    means less harmful gases are released. </p>

                <p>Trees and plants use up harmful gases like carbon dioxide when they respirate and grow. Therefore,
                    the more trees we plant the more carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere, decreasing the
                    potential for global warming. </p>

                <p>Cars also release harmful gases into the atmosphere because they run on fossil fuels. When you ride
                    your bike, walk, use public transport or get a lift with a friend (carpool) you decrease the amount
                    of gases that are released into the air.</p>
